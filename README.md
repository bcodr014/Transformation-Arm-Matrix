# Transformation-Arm-Matrix
The code is designed to calculate the Homogeneous Transformation Arm Matrix for a given robot for upto 6 axis using D-H algorithm and forward kinematics.
Code have some pre-added attributes through which one can calculate the transformation matrix of robots such as Microbot Alpha 2, RHINO XR3, ADEPT ONE, INELLEDEX 660 etc. Just by uncommenting the particular robot.
The pre added attributes give you the transformation matrix of robot at its HOME position, which can further be changed accordingly.

Further this can also be used in calculation of Inverse Kinematic Solutions. (version 2)
